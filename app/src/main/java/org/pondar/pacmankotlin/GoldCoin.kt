//Here you need to fill out what should be in a GoldCoin and what should the constructor be
class GoldCoin(var coinx:Int, var coiny:Int, var taken:Boolean) {




// You will need to create a separate GoldCoin class (one is already in my Project, but not completed)
// to keep track of x and y position
// and also if the coin has been taken or not (if it has been taken, it should not be drawn of course)
// so in the GoldCoin class you need to have a boolean variable called “taken” or something so that you can keep track of
// whether the coin was taken by the pacman (then it should not be drawn) or was not taken.
